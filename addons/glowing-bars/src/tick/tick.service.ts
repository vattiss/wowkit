// One tick: look at the game, then show what is due. Runs every 0.5 seconds in combat and every second out of it, and
// sooner when something happens (RefreshService asks for it). Between the two, each reminder found shows only when its look
// says it may (the When column of the table): always, in combat, out of combat, with a living enemy targeted, or (the low
// reagents and stock) in a town or an inn; and then for its glow time, again with its repeat (GlowSchedule). What is due
// is the finders' to say; when it shows is the player's, for each type and spell.
// A tick makes as few new tables as it can (each one is memory the game has to clear later): the filtered reminders go into
// the same lists every time, and the tests the filter asks are made once.
