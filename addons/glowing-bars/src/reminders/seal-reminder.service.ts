// The paladin's seals: in a fight a seal should be up. The client hides the auras in combat, so a seal counts from the
// player's own cast for its 30 seconds (the "seal" category of the buff memory); a Judgement leaves it on. Any seal
// counts, the seals the player added too. The one that glows is the seal the player last used (kept per character); before
// the first one, the one the main talent tree wants, else the first on the bars. A seal switched off in the table or not
// on the bars is skipped.
