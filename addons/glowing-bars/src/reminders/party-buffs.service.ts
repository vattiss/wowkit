// Party members missing one of the player's buffs, in a party and in a raid (each has its switch). Out of combat only (in
// combat the client hides other units' auras), members online, alive and in range. In a raid every member: a group version
// (Prayer of Fortitude) covers the raid around the caster in Forever; but a blessing only on the classes the player gave
// one there (the others are another paladin's). When enough miss a buff (the player's setting, for a party and for a raid;
// of one class, for Greater Blessings) and the reagent is in the bags, the group version is suggested. The player counts
// too, as the buff reminder sees it: the group version buffs the player as well; but never for the player alone, for whom
// the single buff does. Of a group the one the player wants is
// asked for: the one cast last, else the main talent tree's, else the first. A blessing goes by the member's class: the one
// the player last gave that class (seen on its members), else Wisdom for a class with mana and Kings, else Might, for the
// others; the player's own is the one the buff reminder asks for.
