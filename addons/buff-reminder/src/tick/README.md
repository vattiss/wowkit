# tick/

The reminder loop. A *tick* looks at the game and shows what is due, in two stages:

1. `find-reminders.service.ts` finds everything that is due and returns a `Reminders` value (shows nothing).
2. `show-reminders.service.ts` shows it: sounds for what is new, the notice (`notices.service.ts`), the glows.

| Service | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tick.service.ts` | One tick, every 0.2 seconds (`@Interval(200)`). |
| `refresh.service.ts` | When to look sooner: merges the requests that event bursts cause into one tick. The spells and the bars keep themselves fresh (`@wowkit/wow`); this asks for a tick when they say they changed. |
| `display.service.ts` | Redraws when the spell book, the bars or a setting changed (`@OnEvent`). |

The order in `addon.ts` is the order the lifecycle hooks run in (the spells and the action bars of `@wowkit/wow` read
the game at the first login, before a tick may run). Other features only use `RefreshService`, to ask the
tick to look sooner. Services say with decorators which game events they react to (see
[core/](../../../../packages/core/README.md)); search for an event name to find who reacts.
