# Glowing Bars API for UI addons

[Glowing Bars](https://github.com/vattiss/wowkit/tree/main/addons/glowing-bars) makes the action button the player should
press glow. To have it glow on your addon's own action buttons, register them.

## 1. Load after Glowing Bars

In your `.toc`:

```
## OptionalDeps: GlowingBars
```

## 2. Register your buttons

Once your buttons are made:

```lua
if GlowingBars then
    -- your second bar counts as Action Bar 2
    for i = 1, 12 do
        GlowingBars.RegisterButton(_G["MyBar2Button" .. i], 2)
    end
    -- the stance bar (forms, paladin auras...)
    for i = 1, 10 do
        GlowingBars.RegisterStanceButton(_G["MyStanceButton" .. i], i)
    end
end
```

- `RegisterButton(button, bar)`: `bar` is the Action Bar (1 to 8) the button counts as, so the player's settings for that
  bar apply to it. Leave it out for a button of no bar.
- `RegisterStanceButton(button, stance)`: `stance` is the stance the button stands for, 1 the first.

The button needs its action slot where Blizzard's buttons keep it (`button.action` or the `action` attribute). Buttons
made from `ActionBarButtonTemplate` or with LibActionButton-1.0 have it.

That's all: the glows show on your buttons within a few seconds.

## 3. Round buttons

**Without a shape**, as above, a button gets Blizzard's square proc glow, which suits square buttons. Two kinds of
round button are known without being told:

- Forever's own gamepad bars: Glowing Bars finds them by itself, so they need no registering.
- A registered button that says its shape the way Forever's gamepad buttons do, in `button.activeButtonShape = "Circle"`.

**With a shape**, your round buttons glow round too: the client's own round gamepad highlight, in place of the square
glow. Pass the shape as a third argument, to either function:

```lua
if GlowingBars then
    -- a gamepad bar of round buttons, of no Action Bar
    for i = 1, 12 do
        GlowingBars.RegisterButton(_G["MyPadButton" .. i], nil, "Circle")
    end
    -- round stance buttons
    for i = 1, GetNumShapeshiftForms() do
        GlowingBars.RegisterStanceButton(_G["MyPadStanceButton" .. i], i, "Circle")
    end
end
```

- `"Circle"`: the round glow.
- `"Square"`: the square glow, even on a button whose `activeButtonShape` says otherwise.
- Nothing, or anything else: as without a shape.

The shape you give comes first. The glow is made the first time the button glows, so give the shape when you
register it.

## Checking it

`/dump GlowingBars` in game shows the two functions. Drop a buff of your class that is on one of your buttons, and the
button glows.
